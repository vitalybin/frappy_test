This directory contains the necessary files for running tests inside a docker container.

The Dockerfile defines two images:
- base
  -> this is the image used for testing
- docs
  -> Include a latex install for sphinx pdf builds

(The following assumes you have a docker daemon running on your working computer)

To create the images:

  docker build --target <base|docs> --tag frappy_<base|docs>:latest .

To test images interactivly:
  docker run -u jenkins -i -t frappy<base|docs> /bin/bash

The Jenkinsfile uses this Dockerfile (only approved checked-in versions from master)
to build the images (a rebuild will only happen if the Dockerfile is changed as docker
 caches the images and build information) and  run the test suite inside the container.
